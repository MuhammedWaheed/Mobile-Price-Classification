# Mobile-Price-Classification


# Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop classification model for dataset that hold specifications of 2000 mobile phones attempt to predict best price ranges by applying various machine learning algorithm.

# Dataset:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iabhishekofficial/mobile-price-classification

➢ It contains  2000 sample 

➢ 21 feature and our goal is to predict  a price range indicating how high the price is.

➢ Integer and float datatype



# Problem Description

Prabhat Doongarwal  has started his own mobile company. He wants to give tough fight to big companies like Apple,Samsung etc. He does not know how to estimate price of mobiles his company creates. In this competitive mobile phone market you cannot simply assume things. To solve this problem he collects sales data of mobile phones of various companies. Prabhat wants to find out some relation between features of a mobile phone(eg:- RAM, Internal Memory etc) and its selling price. But he is not so good at Machine Learning. So he needs your help to solve this problem. In this problem you do not have to predict actual price but a price range indicating how high the price is.

## The Data Preprocessing

I. Description of Data

II. Info about the data

III. Check if the data has missing values or not

IV. Detecting outliers

V. The Correlation between the attributes

VI. Features Selection using SelectKBest

VII. CHeck if the data balanced or not 

VIII. The attributes that are most correlated with the Price Range ( Our target )

# Applyed Models :

(1) Logistic Regression

(2) Decision Tree(gini)

(3) Random Forest

(4) KNN

(5) Naive Bayes

(6) LSVM

# Hyperparameters 

W used GridSearch algorithm to select the best hyperparameters for our models  and get the best result for every model we used .

# Conclusion

We compared the accuracies of all the models and found that LSVM is the best classifier for our project
